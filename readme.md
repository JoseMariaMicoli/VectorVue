## 🚀 Usage Procedure

### 1. Initialization

* **Clone & Clean:** Clone this repo for each new engagement.
* **Checklist:** Start with `01-Pre-Engagement/checklist.md` to verify all legal and scope requirements are signed.

### 2. Referencing Examples

If you are unsure how to word a finding or how to structure the attack narrative, refer to the **`examples/`** folder. It contains fully populated dummy reports that demonstrate:

* How to translate technical vulnerabilities into business risk.
* The level of detail required for "Reproduction Steps."
* How to properly annotate screenshots and link them in Markdown.

### 3. Drafting the Report

* **Technical First:** Document findings in `04-Technical-Details/` as they occur. Use the `remediation-library.md` to ensure your advice is industry-standard (OWASP/NIST).
* **Risk Heatmap:** Use the `03-Risk-Assessment/matrix.md` to rank your findings.
* **Executive Narrative:** Draft the final summary for management in `02-Executive-Summary/`.

### 4. Final Delivery

* **Conversion:** Convert your `.md` files to PDF using **Pandoc** or **Obsidian**.
* **Handover:** Deliver the **Final PDF** and the **Remediation Tracker (xlsx)** to the client.
